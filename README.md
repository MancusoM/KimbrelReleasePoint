# KimbrelReleasePoint
In 2021, Craig Kimbrel, a Major-League Baseball pitcher struggled after his midseason trade to the Chicago White Sox. I wanted to look at if there was a substantial  difference in his vertical and horizontal release point after the trade occured, as compared to before. I found that his release point stayed generally consistent throughout the season  & there must another reason for his struggles.
